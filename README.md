## 💿 Installation

1. Make sure you have `Node` installed. The project uses `Node v18.4.0`.
2. In your Terminal, go to the folder from where you want to run your tests and `git clone` this repository.
3. `cd` to the project folder and install the deps:

`npm install`

You are ready to run the tests.

## ✅ Running tests

There are two script commands that can initiate the test run:

1. `npm run cypress:open` - Opens the Cypress App, from where you can choose the browser and test suite. Runs the tests.
2. `npm run cypress:run` - runs Cypress tests to completion. By default, `cypress:run` will run all tests headlessly. Shoots a video from every run.

To start the script, go to the root folder of the project in your Terminal and type one of the commands in.
